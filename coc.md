#Functional Programming Slack team Code of Conduct

The purpose of the Functional Programing Slack team is to discuss - you guessed it - functional programming. The goal of this Code of Conduct is to ensure that this purpose continues to be served and that members understand, in broad terms, behavior that is unnacceptable in any of the channels on the team. 

It is impossible to legislate perfection so this CoC is not designed to outline every bannable offense or lay out, in specifity, an exhaustive list of what is and isn't allowed. The goal is much more modest: to make sure that members understand the spirit they should uphold and to avoid any surprises in the unfortunate circumstance that someone gets removed from the channel for violating that spirit. 

To date, the vast majority of participants have fostered an incredible atmosphere of collaboration, with members offering advice, feedback, etc and we expect that will continue. There have been rare occurences of flagrant or derogatory language being directed at other members. There have been threats of violence. This behavior has no place on the team. 

Clear-cut and eggregious violations may result in immediate removal from the team without warning. If there's an isolated incident followed by a quick resolution or apology to the point where it's clear to any sane, objective third-party that the offending members' continued presence on the team presents no substantial impediment to continued productive discussion focused on FP, we hope a warning will suffice and we can all move on. 

What _precisely_ qualifies as "resolution" or "apology"? I'm not going to define those terms precisely because this CoC is not intended to be sprawling regulatory framework which would require lawyers to interpret prior to enforcement. Instead, we've placed significant trust in the few admins and other long-standing key members to assess situations on a case-by-case basis. 

In a word, if you are removed from the team, it means you blatantly violated very basic, very reasonable expectations of good behavior and you're kidding yourself if you think otherwise. 

Some _examples_ (but NOT an exhaustive list of bad behavior):

- racist language directed at someone
- sexist language directed at someone 
- homophobic language directed at someone 
- any other derogation of a person on the basis of their identity of any kind 
- "fuck you" directed at someone (not said in jest)
- "I'm going to kill you" (not said in jest) or any other threats of violence
- monopolizing channels with personal conflicts to the point where it dominates the conversations and affects the ability of members to focus on the channel topic

All but the last of these apply to communications via Direct Messages as well, not just channels. 

Admins aren't keen on spending their time monitoring or policing activity in the channels. But if we witness violations of this CoC or if such behavior is brought to our attention, we will respond as described above. 

If you behavior in violation of this CoC is directed at you, please reach out to one of the admins directly: @levinotik @dk @dridus @tpflug @rickasaurus @reedcopsey @fixplz
